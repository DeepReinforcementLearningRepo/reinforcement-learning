##### Summary
- Capturing image from the game - **OK**
- Allowing control programmatically - **OK**
- Trying a simple implementation of rules-based agent with classic CV algorithms - **OK** 
- Capturing scores for fitness and reward - **OK**
- Creating the environment for RL - **OK**
- Developing a RL agent that learns via evolution strategies
  - Feature engineering the input with detected boundaries
  - Taking raw image as input
  - Taking processed image as input
  - Initialize the agent with hard coded policy
- Combine the RL agent and the rules-based Agent
